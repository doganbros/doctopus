Manual Setup
#########################

Manual Setup installs each component individually to maximize control and configurability. All components can be installed into a single machine, provided the machine has an FQDN, and is strong enough to meet the requirements. Please make sure the certificate for the domain includes not only the domain itself, but all its belonging subdomains as well. You may ensure it by using a wildcard like "*.mydomain.com" when procuring the certificate.

******************
Setting Up Purpie
******************

Requirements
============

* `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_ (>= 10.13.0, except for v13) (Windows Build Tools for Windows systems)

* `Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install>`_ 

* `NestCli <https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview>`_ 

* `Postgres <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ 


Getting Started
===============

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/doganbros/purpie # Clone Repository
  cd purpie

Install dependencies with

.. code-block:: bash

  yarn install
  
Set Environment Variables Into .env File
=======================================

You may configure the environment by making a copy of the boilerplate provided. The functionality of each environment variable is documented within the ``.env.example`` file.

.. code-block:: bash

  cp .env.example .env # Then make changes to the boilerplate provided

Creating Postgres Database
========================

Please follow the steps below to get a development Postgres server running. The easiest way to use `docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_. If you have running Postgres database server you can skip these steps and simply create an Purpie database.

* Make sure you have docker installed on your computer. If you do not have docker already on your computer, Go to `this link <https://www.docker.com/get-started/>`_, choose your platform and click download. Follow the simple steps to get docker installed on your computer.

* Open your terminal (command prompt or preferably powershell on windows).

* Enter the command ``docker run --name purpie-dev -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD -p 5432:5432 -d postgres``. Postgres docker image will be downloaded and Postgres Docker container with the name purpie-dev will up and serve from port 5432 after this command.

* Run ``docker exec -it purpie-dev psql -U postgres`` to connect your Postgres database.

* Inside the docker container, run ``CREATE DATABASE 'purpie';`` to create your Purpie database.

* Run ``\q`` to quit from Psql and Docker container.

* Remember to update ``DB_USER``, ``DB_PASSWORD``, ``DB_DATABASE`` and ``DB_HOST`` .env variables to your database user name, database password database name, and database host respectively.


***************************************
Running Purpie
***************************************
 
.. code-block:: bash

  yarn server:start:dev # Runs backend side in dev mode
  yarn start:server # Runs backend in production
  yarn start:web # Runs frontend side
  
You may refer to this `sample NGINX config <https://github.com/doganbros/purpie/tree/master/external/nginx>`_ to set up your Purpie web server.
  
****************
Setting up Jitsi
****************

Installing Jitsi with JWT support
=================================

Purpie mmakes use of Jitsi for video streaming and live meeting purposes. It requires a Jitsi installation with JWT token support. You can refer to `this document <https://doganbros.com/index.php/jitsi/jitsi-installation-with-jwt-support-on-ubuntu-18-04-lts/>`_ by us to install Jitsi. Remember to update the ``.env`` variable by setting ``JWT_APP_ID``'s value to ``YOUR_APP_ID``, ``JITSI_SECRET`` to ``YOUR_SECRET`` and ``JITSI_DOMAIN`` to the domain where you set up jitsi.

Istalling Purpie Jitsi Module
------------------------------
This module is a React Module that applies on top of Jitsi to provide visual and functional differentiations. To avoid issues regarding version mismatch, start with the customized Jitsi repo below;

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/doganbros/purpie-jitsi-meet.git
  cd purpie-jitsi-meet
  
The module is included in the package.json file within the repository. Therefore, you are able to simply follow the promtps as shown;

.. code-block:: bash

  npm install
  export WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_PROXY_TARGET=https://yourdomain.com
  make

At this point, your customized Jitsi is built and ready to serve. Make sure to edit the NGINX configuration accordingly to make use of your new directory.

Integrating Jitsi with Purpie
=================================

* This .lua module for Jitsi Meet manages the integration between purpie and Jitsi. It enables Jitsi to send reports to Purpie. To enable it, follow the instructions below.

.. code-block:: bash

  cp ./external/prosody-modules/mod_octopus.lua /usr/share/jitsi-meet/prosody-plugins

Configuring Prosody
-------------------

* Edit your prosody configuration at ``/etc/prosody/conf.d/your.domain.com.cfg.lua``, and add the following lines.

.. code-block:: lua

  octopusApiKey = "yourAPIkey";
  octopusApiSecret =  "yourAPIsecret";
  octopusAPIBaseUrl = "https://your.baseAPI.url";
  
* In the same file, add octopus to the list of enabled modules of the conference component like below;

.. code-block:: lua

  Component "conference.meet.doganbros.com" "muc"
      restrict_room_creation = true
      storage = "memory"
      modules_enabled = {
          "muc_meeting_id";
          "muc_domain_mapper";
          "polls";
          "octopus";
          "token_verification";
      }
      admins = { "focus@auth.meet.doganbros.com" }
      muc_room_locking = false
      muc_room_default_public_jids = true
      
Installing Jibri
================

To install Jibri you can follow `this tutorial <https://community.jitsi.org/t/tutorial-how-to-install-the-new-jibri/88861>`_.

Customizing the Finalize Script
--------------------------------

* Find the following in your ``/etc/jitsi/jibri/jibri.conf`` file, and replace path with ``/srv/finalize/octopus-finalize.sh``

.. code-block:: lua

  jibri {
      recording {
          finalize-script = <path>
      }
  }

* Copy the included finalize.sh file to your finalize script directory. This .sh file runs upon the completion of recording, and both uploads the recorded file to an S3 bucket, and manages Jibri's integration with Purpie.

.. code-block:: bash

  cp {./external/jibri/octopus-finalize.conf, octopus-finalize.sh} /srv/finalize

* Edit ``/srv/finalize/octopus-finalize.conf`` accordingly, and restart Jibri.

.. code-block:: bash
  systemctl restart jibri
  
***************************************
Setting up the Ingress RTMP servers
***************************************

For Purpie, you will need at least one ingress server, and as many additional egress servers as you need for ease of autoscalability. To install NGINX rtmp server, you can follow the guide in `this page <https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/dynamic-modules/rtmp/>`_. Remember to update the ``RTMP_INGRESS_URL`` and ``RTMP_EGRESS_URL`` .env variables to your ingress and egress server url respectively.

Integrating the RTMP server with Purpie
=====================================

* Head into the RTMP server, and use the following to copy the required scripts. ``sample-nginx.conf`` contains a working example for an RTMP server, who calls upon ``octopus.sh`` in its workflow. ``octopus.sh`` is the script that maintains the integration between the RTMP server and Purpie. ``octopus-sh.conf`` contains customizable variables for the script.

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir /home/purpie
  cp {./external/rtmp/octopus.sh, ./external/rtmp/octopus-sh.conf} /home/purpie
  cp ./external/rtmp/sample-nginx.conf /etc/nginx


* Navigate to ``/home/purpie`` and edit the contents of ``octopus-sh.conf`` accordingly. Then restart nginx.

.. code-block:: bash

  systemctl restart nginx
